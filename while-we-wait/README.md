# While We Wait
## Task
Using a loop, iterate through the provided array. Stop when you get to the first string that is NOT "wait". Print to the console the number of items you looped through before getting to the stopping point

Example:
```bash
let myArray = [ "wait", "wait", "wait", "GO", "wait", "wait" ]
```
Using the above array the output would be the following:
```bash
3
```
