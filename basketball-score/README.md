# Basketball Score
## Task
Your task is to calculate a basketball score given an array of strings. Once you have calculated the score, print the following string:
```
Final Score: <score>
```
You will see 3 different strings worth different values:

"fg" is worth 2 points
"ft" is worth 1 point
"tp" is worth 3 points

Example:
```bash
let myArray = [ "fg", "fg", "ft", "tp" ]
```

Output:
```bash
Final Score: 8
```
